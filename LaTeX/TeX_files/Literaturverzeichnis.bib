	abstract = {PML nuclear bodies (NBs) are involved in the regulation of key nuclear pathways but their biochemical function in nuclear metabolism is unknown. In this study PML NB assembly dynamics were assessed by live cell imaging and mathematic modeling of its major component parts. We show that all six nuclear PML isoforms exhibit individual exchange rates at NBs and identify PML V as a scaffold subunit. SP100 exchanges at least five times faster at NBs than PML proteins. Turnover dynamics of PML and SP100 at NBs is modulated by SUMOylation. Exchange is not temperature-dependent but depletion of cellular ATP levels induces protein immobilization at NBs. The PML-RARα oncogene exhibits a strong NB retention effect on wild-type PML proteins. HIPK2 requires an active kinase for PML NB targeting and elevated levels of PML IV increase its residence time. DAXX and BLM turn over rapidly and completely at PML NBs within seconds. These findings provide a kinetics model for factor exchange at PML NBs and highlight potential mechanisms to regulate intranuclear trafficking of specific factors at these domains.},

	abstract={Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is a laser microscopy technique extensively used to determine kinetic properties of cells using fluorophores. FRAP is based on irreversibly bleaching a set of proteins tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in a region of interest and monitoring the recovery in fluorescence due to diffusion of surrounding intact probes into the bleached spot. FRAP is being widely used in many areas of biology to measure molecular transport and diffusion in comparison with mathematical models derived for specific domains. This study focused on deriving mathematical models of FRAP for various geometries and conditions depending on their locations in the cell, creating a database, and constructing a mathematical model with the help of MATLAB. FRAP models for pure diffusion for various geometries in 1~2 spatial dimensions with different boundary conditions, which are applicable to both conventional and confocal FRAP, was considered. For a circular bleaching spot, the geometries considered were infinite line, finite interval, a circle, infinite plane, sphere, and infinite three-dimensional space for reflective and restrictive boundary conditions if applicable. Finally, future directions are proposed to focus on interesting ways to apply this new model in vivo.},

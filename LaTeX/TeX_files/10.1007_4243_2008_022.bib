abstract="The field of chemical sensors and biosensors based on fluorescence and phosphorescence is becomingincreasingly popular and advances are being reported at a rapid pace. It therefore appears worthwhileto classify these efforts to aid both newcomers and experts of the field in being able to view their workand those of others within a wider context. Among several classification schemes possible, here, onewith respect to the mode of action is presented. After historical milestones and definitions of chemicalsensors and biosensors are being reviewed briefly, the field is subdivided into six major types: Plainfluorometric sensors, direct- and indirect indicator-mediated chemical sensors, direct enzymatic biosensors,indicator-mediated enzymatic biosensors, and affinity biosensors. The discussion is accompanied by examplesand further subdivisions for some sensor types.",
